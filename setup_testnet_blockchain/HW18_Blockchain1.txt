Set up your custom testnet blockchain: (Proof of Work  consensus algorithm  used)

    Generated genesis block

    Created two accounts for nodes:
        node1
        password = benad1
        Public address of the key:   0x64f6A7CDA3DD2Cb9C989A213812EF3C5f9454D06
        Path of the secret key file: node1\keystore\UTC XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  
        
        
        code used: ./geth account new --datadir node1 

        node2
        password = benad2
        Public address of the key:   0x6B17B89B7e9522Bf6Bd20BF7BA73444AAecbda35
        Path of the secret key file: node2\keystore\UTC xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 
        
        
        code used: ./geth account new --datadir node2 


    Initialized nodes using the genesis block:

        Successfully Initialized   image: init_node1.png    image: setup_tesnet_blockchain/Screenshots/init_node1.png
        Successfully Initialized   image: init_node2.png    image: setup_tesnet_blockchain/Screenshots/init_node2.png
        code used:    ./geth init goldeninti.json --datadir node1
        code used:    ./geth init goldeninti.json --datadir node2  

    
    Starting both nodes

        node1` will be a full node that is mining.
        node2` will be a full node that exposes an RPC port, allowing to talk to it with other apps like MyCrypto.

        node1:
        code used:  ./geth --datadir node1 --mine --minerthreads 1
        * The `--mine` flag tells the node to mine new blocks.
        * The `--minerthreads` flag tells `geth` how many CPU threads, or "workers" to use during mining.
          Since the difficulty is low, the set is 1.
          Mining node1   image: mining_node1  setup_tesnet_blockchain/Screenshots/mining_node1.png
        * Port 30303 used by default. 
       
        node2:
        code used: ./geth --datadir node2 --port 30304 --rpc --bootnodes "enode://f9e4aa75d19cfc192ac8cbee37466ba677d220c0d143a85192676334fcf09da5d5456f0a765f487fbefd8379c9faf17f3c10f2454b6e1e3361c2b61cfc4e8486@127.0.0.1:30303" --ipcdisable
        -- port 30304 (since node1 use 30303 by default)

        Kovan
        Nemonic Phrase
        Pre-fund account
        Wallet info
        Copy and paste private key

     Custom Node selected and connected 
        Open up MyCrypto
        Change network
        Add custom node:
                  
            Network = custom 
            Node name = node1
            Network name = goldeninti
            Currency = ETH
            Chain id = 453
            URL = http://127.0.0.1:8545 


    How to Use the Network


        Open the wallet that you use to pre-fund the chain during genesis creation as follows:

            * On the left pane menu, click on "View & Send".

            * Change network to goldeninti

            * Next, click on the "Private Key" and paste PRIVATE KEY option to continue.

            * A new window will pop-up, paste the private key of the pre-fund wallet and click on the "Unlock" button to continue.

            * You will see the balance of the pre-funded account. For testing puposes looked like we're filthy rich!, this is the balance that was pre-funded for this account in the genesis configuration;
            
              these millions of ETH tokens were just for testing purposes.

            * Put the address to send ETH. For testing purposes copy the pre-fund address into the "To Address" field, then fill in an arbitrary amount of ETH,
            
             to send ETH to yourself - same address for testing purposes. Image setup_tesnet_blockchain/Screenshots/test_connecting_goldeninti.png

            * Confirm the transaction by clicking "Send Transaction", and the "Send" button in the pop-up window.

            * Click the `Check TX Status` when the green message pops up, confirm the logout:
